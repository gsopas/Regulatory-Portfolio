## 🚀 Professional Profile
I am a **Materials Scientist** transitioning into **Regulatory Affairs**, bridging the gap between high-level laboratory research and global market authorisation. My background includes 3+ years of doctoral-level research in **Alzheimer’s pharmacology** and small-molecule inorganic synthesis. 

I specialise in the **Regulatory Frame**: utilising risk-based justifications and data-driven strategies to expedite market entry for complex drug products.

## 📁 Featured Project: Amoxicillin Suspension ARTG Registration
This project demonstrates the transition of a legacy generic product into the Australian market, addressing critical compliance gaps through the eCTD framework.

### 📋 Project Strategic Overview
| Component | Status | Regulatory Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Submission Category** | Category 1 | New Generic Medicine (Section 23) |
| **Quality Gap (ICH Q3D)** | Identified | Remediated via ICP-MS Quantitative Analysis |
| **Stability Gap (Zone IVb)** | Mitigation | 12-Month Shelf Life Commitment + Post-Approval Variation |
| **GMP Evidence** | Validated | MRA/CV Pathway (AIFA Italy to TGA Australia) |

### 🛠️ Key Regulatory Skills Demonstrated
* **Administrative Strategy (M1):** Drafting TGO 91-compliant labeling, S4 Poison Scheduling, and Biowaiver justifications.
* **Scientific Authority (M2.3):** Developing Quality Overall Summaries (QOS) based on physicochemical properties (Zeta Potential, Rheology, pH Buffering).
* **Digital Literacy:** Mastery of eCTD hierarchy and AI-augmented regulatory drafting for maximum efficiency.

## 🧪 Doctoral Research Background (Inorganic chemistry)
During my tenure as a **Doctoral Researcher**, I focused on the synthesis of novel inhibitors for Alzheimer’s disease. My work resulted in:
* The synthesis of pharmaceutical agents currently utilised in ongoing peer-reviewed research.
* Study of the kinetics of copper and zinc in the brain of Alzheimer's disease models. 
* Mastery of the "Critical Quality Attribute" mindset from the bench-top level up.
